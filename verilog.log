             ** CVER VERILOG SIMULATOR HELP MESSAGE **
 
  Cver is a Verilog HDL simulator following the 1995 IEEE P1364 standard
  with some 2001 P1364 LRM features added and some modifications to match
  actual behavior of de facto standard XL simulator.  Modeling in C/C++ and
  Verilog using PLI 1 and PLI 2 interfaces is supported.  PLI implementation
  follows 2001 P1364 LRM.  Cver now supports faster compiled to byte code
  virtual machine (VM) execution simulation selected using -O (optimize on)
  option (** NOTE -O not available in GPL Cver).  See release notes in doc
  directory for list of P1364 2001 supported features and list of known
  problems.
 
  Usage:  cver [intermixed options and Verilog source files].
 
  Command line and -f command file options must be in lower case and must
  begin with a - or +.  Each option requires a separate - or +.  Type
  'cver -?' or 'cver -h' to generate this help message.  To enter the
  Verilog statement interactive debugger (press interrupt (^c) or execute
  $stop), then type :help' for interactive debugger help.
 
  It is assumed that you already know Verilog and have access to a P1364 LRM
  or other Verilog documentation.  Cver supports both PLI (Programming
  Language Interface) 1 tf_ and acc_ and PLI 2 vpi_ utility, design object
  and callback routines using +loadpli1= and +loadvpi= dynamic PLI load
  options defined below.  Both old PLI 1 and new PLI 2 libraries can be
  dynamically loaded during one run.  See examples in examples.vpi,
  examples.tf and examples.acc release directories for examples showing how
  to link and run PLI models.  If you need to statically link PLI models, you
  must obtain different Cver binary and cverobj.o library.  Cver contains a
  number of new system tasks and functions.  See systasks.1 man page in the
  doc directory for definition of every system task and system function
  supported by Cver.
 
  Cver generally produces results matching other simulators even when other
  simulators differ from P1364 standard up to differences in event order.
  However, Cver does not change port direction because of net connection
  direction (i.e. treat nets with wrong side of port drivers as inouts)
  unless the +change_port_type option is selected.  It is suggested that
  you change your designs so port type changing is not needed, but for full
  compatibility with other simulators always run with +change_port_type
  option.  Cver implements pulse (glitch) detection for gates as well as
  paths.  This may cause some simulation result differences.  This more
  stringent pulse analysis is consistent with Cver's intended use as
  accurate gate level simulator.
 
  Since all options are collected before processing, if any options are
  duplicated, the rightmost (last) will be used.  All Cver options are
  listed in this help message.  Any other option will be ignored by Cver
  although it may be scanned and used by a user PLI routine.  All options
  not listed in this help message will have warning 506 emitted for minus
  options and inform 410 for plus options.
 
  Options defined in the IEEE P1364 reference manual are supported and have
  the following effect:
 
   -f [file]  Read options and source file names from [file] until it is
         exhausted at which point continue reading from command line.  May
         be nested.
   -l [file]  By default all output is written to stdout and to log file
         verilog.log.  -l changes to log file [file].  System task
         $log([file]) changes to log file [file] during simulation, $nolog
         turns off log file output.  Added system task $flushlog calls OS
         fflush on log file.  $reset does not reset log file.
   -s    Stop just before starting simulation and enter interactive debugger.
   -i [file]  Read interactive debugger commands from file [file] the first
         time interactive mode is entered (usually with -s but possibly by
         $stop or interrupt signal (^c)).  Nested -i [file] options are
         chained not nested.
   -c    Translate source and all referenced library models only.  Ends just
         before loading the translated model into memory.
   -w    Suppress all warning messages.  See +suppress_warns added option for
         suppression of warnings and informs by message number.
   -d    Dump source that is constructed from internal representation.  All
         parameters are replaced by their constant value in the
         reconstructed source output.  Debugger source listing lists lines
         from source files instead of reconstructing source.
   -q    Quiet mode.  Do not print normal progress messages.  Opposite
         of -q is +verbose that prints even more progress messages than normal.
   +mindelays, +typdelays, +maxdelays  Choose either minimum, typical or
         maximum value from any constant (min:typ:max) forms in source.
         Selection is made during input scanning so min:typ:max forms
         become constant numbers at translation time.
   -t    Trace procedural statement execution.  Use -et to trace event
         processing.  In other simulators, -t means both -t and -et.
         $settrace,  $setevtrace, $cleartrace, $clearevtrace to control
         tracing during simulation.
   +libnocell  Ignore `celldefine directives in source and libraries.  This
         should not be used if delay back annotation is used since it will
         probably cause annotation to fail.
   +notimingchecks  After checking for correct syntax, ignore timing checks.
   -u    Ignored.  For all upper case, use an OS filter command to convert
         source to all upper case.
 
  Only default and +librescan library scanning order supported.  By default
  all library files from -v [file] and all directories of library elements
  from -y [directory] are scanned from first to last according to input option
  order.  If unresolved names remain after completion of a pass, the list is
  rescanned from the beginning.  If +librescan option is selected, unresolved
  names are resolved one at a time in order they are first seen.  After a
  name has been resolved, the next name in order is resolved by rescanning
  from the beginning of library list.  Options to control order dependent
  resolution and +libnamehide are not implemented.  Library options are:
 
   -v [file]   Treat [file] as a library containing module and UDP
         definitions.  File is sequentially searched for definitions that
         resolve unresolved names.  Within a -v file, if a name if defined
         before use, it is resolved before moving to next library element.
   -y [directory]  Treat every file in [directory] as a -v library although
         usually each file will only contain one definition.  File name in
         directory along with +libext+ option used to find unresolved name.
   +libext+  In -y directory files, name resolution uses file names.  If
         no +libext+ option is present only files whose name exactly
         matches an unresolved module or primitive will be read.  There can
         be no extension.  Normally, each -y file will contain the
         definition for exactly one element but if more elements are present
         they will be used to resolve other unresolved elements.  Use
         +libext+[extension with dot]+[extension with dot]+...  to cause
         file name extensions to be removed before matching file names to
         unresolved element names.  Only one +libext+ option may appear and
         matching is in order when library extensions do not follow the
         simple .[suffix name] convention.  If all files in -y directories
         end with either .v or .V (a common case), use +libext+.v+.V+
   +librescan  Rescan to beginning of library file and directory list after
         every unresolved name is resolved.  At most one name resolved per
         library pass.
   +libverbose  Emit detailed trace messages giving resolution order and
         reason a particular element was resolved at the particular place.
   +show_canceled_e  Path and gate (1 bit continuous assignments implemented
         as gates) outputs set to X when pulses occur that cause scheduled
         but not matured events to be canceled because second input edge
         occurs before output has changed (switched).  The output
         remains at X until another input edge causes an output change
         because it is unknown if a pulse (glitch) will cause output
         switching.  Some other simulators use a less pessimistic algorithm
         that assumes pulses never cause switching and schedule a change
         from X back to original output value on trailing edge of pulse.  If
         your model will not run, use the +warn_canceled_e instead of this
         option and examine warnings.  Cver does not allow only some
         paths and gates to use pulse X showing using specify section
         directives because X showing does not slow down simulation.
         Normally X from a pulse is shown on leading edge of glitch.  Use
         +pulse_e_style_ondetect to cause X to be shown(driven) when pulse
         detected from input change.  Option is standardized replacement for
         previous +spikes option.
   +noshow_canceled_e  Path and gate outputs not driven (shown) as X when
         pulses occur (second input change earlier than selected delay).
         This is the default (normally it is not needed).  It selects normal
         Verilog inertial delay algorithm where the latest input change
         causes the previously scheduled but unmatured event to be canceled.
   +pulse_e_style_ondetect  If +show_canceled_e option selected, this option
         causes output to be set to X (shown) when the pulse (glitch) is
         detected.  If this option is not selected, output is set to X
         (shown) when the pulse propagates to an output.  This option
         selects a more pessimistic (starting earlier) X region.
   +pulse_e_style_onevent  If +show_canceled_e option selected, this option
         selects the default output setting to X (showing) option that sets
         output to X when glitch propagates to output (leading edge is time
         at which the event scheduled latest matures).  There is no reason
         to use this option since it is default.  Control of X showing for
         individual gates and paths is not supported.
   +warn_canceled_e  Emit warning for every gate (including UDP) or path event
         cancel (inertial cancel and reschedule).  This option may cause
         voluminous output so the $suppress_warns and $allow_warns system
         tasks can be used to select particular time periods when warnings
         are emitted.  This option and +show_canceled_e are unrelated so both
         error messages and x showing (injection) may be enabled.
   +nowarn_canceled_e  Because this option is the default it is never needed
         Last of all +warn_canceled_e and +nowarn_canceled_e is used.
 
  The following two options for dynamically loading user PLI libraries are
  not explicitly defined in IEEE P1364 reference manual but are supported
  by all modern simulators.  If you need to statically link your PLI models
  you must request a different Cver binary and cverobj.o static PLI library,
  but we strongly encourage use of dynamic PLI loading:
 
   +loadpli1=[.so library]:[boostrap routines]  Load [.so library] dynamic
         library containing user PLI 1 model and execute each bootstrap
         routine.  [bootstrap routines] is a comma separated list of C
         routines.  List may be empty but : is still required.  No spaces
         are allowed around the equal sign, the colon or commas separating
         bootstrap C routine names.  All dynamic libraries defined by
         +loadpli1= options are first loaded using OS dlopen mechanism and
         then all bootstrap routines are executed before elaboration begins.
         The OS specific dynamic library suffix (.so on Linux) may be
         omitted.  If omitted and the [.so library] is not found in any
         LD_LIBRARY_PATH directory, the dynamic library suffix is added and
         the LD_LIBRARY_PATH directories are searched again.
 
         Each [bootstrap routines] list routine must return a pointer to a
         s_tfcell veriusertfs table that ends with zero value type field.
         Multiple +loadpli1= options are allowed and just before elaboration
         all [bootstrap routines] for every +loadpli1= option are executed.
         Each s_tfcell returned table is added to one design wide master
         s_tfcell table in option and routine in list order.  The master
         table defines all PLI 1 system functions and tasks used during a
         simulation run.  The [bootstrap routines] must not call any PLI
         routines.  Any C file containing [bootstrap routines] list must
         include both veriuser.h and cv_veriuser.h files.  Some OS shells
         may require quoting and escaping option separators and file names
         within the +loadpli1= option string.  Problem can be avoided by
         coding +loadpli1= option in a -f command argument file. See release
         examples.tf directory in tests_and_examples directory for example
         PLI 1 programs and make files specific to your operating system.
   +loadvpi=[.so library]:[boostrap routines]  Load [.so library] dynamic
         library containing user PLI 2 vpi model and execute each bootstrap
         routine.  [bootstrap routines] is a comma separated list of C/C++
         routines.  List may be empty but : is still required.  No spaces
         are allowed around the equal sign, the colon or commas separating
         bootstrap C routine names.  All dynamic libraries defined by
         +loadvpi= options are first loaded using OS dlopen mechanism and
         then all bootstrap routines are executed before elaboration begins.
         The OS specific dynamic library suffix (.so on Linux) may be
         omitted.  If omitted and the [.so library] is not found in any
         LD_LIBRARY_PATH directory, the dynamic library suffix is added and
         the LD_LIBRARY_PATH directories are searched again.
 
         Each [bootstrap routines] is saved on an ordered list and executed
         in order before elaboration begins.  Normally [bootstrap routines]
         will execute routines in vlog_startup_routines table, but any PLI 2
         vpi routines callable before elaboration may be called including
         vpi_register_systf and vpi_register_cb PLI 2 routines.  Some OS
         shells may require quoting and escaping option separators and file
         names within the +loadvpi= option string.  Problem can be avoided by
         coding +loadvpi= option in a -f command argument file. See release
         examples.vpi directory for example PLI 1 programs and make files
         specific to your operating system.
 
  The following other options not defined in the IEEE P1364 reference manual
  are supported:
   +verbose  Print various simulation progress messages and design component
         counts.  Memory sizes do not count memory used by udp tables.
   +maxerrors [number]  Normally translation terminates after 32
         errors.  Use this option to change the number. 0 means no limit.
         Option applies to translation only, simulation is never stopped.
   -e    Turn off printing of non fatal error messages.
   -informs  Turn on printing of informatory messages.  Off by default.
         Informs may be emitted during translation and during simulation.
         Enable this option to determine if a plus option is misspelled and
         to cause OS error message description strings to be printed.
         Option will probably produce voluminous output unless
         +suppress_warns+[+ separated list] option(s) also used.
   -O    Turn on simulation byte code optimizer (**NOTE not available in
         GPL Cver).  If this option is selected statement breakpoints
         can not be set but all other interpreter features are supported.
   -et   Turn on event tracing.  Option is similar to the -t (or $settrace)
         option but -t only traces procedural execution.  To dynamically
         control event tracing use $setevtrace and $clearevtrace system
         tasks.  Option produces voluminous output. Use -t and -et to
         duplicate other simulator -t tracing.
   +tracefile [name]  Set the output file for any trace output (either
         statement or event).  Use $settracefile system task to change
         trace file during execution.  Name can be stdout and if no option
         or $tracefile, defaults to stdout and log file.  $flushlog system
         task flushes this file during simulation.
   +printstats  Print tables of design contents.  Primitives, instances,
         and wires that will use silicon area are tabulated.  More
         detailed alternative to $showallinstances.
   +printallstats  Option equivalent to +printstats but additionally prints
         the declarative content of every module.
   +suppress_warns+  Individual warning and informatory messages can be
         suppressed (not errors) by including a + separated list. i.e.
         +suppress_warns+403+502+507+564+.  All such options are combined.
         The $suppress_warns([comma separated list]) and $allow_warns
         system tasks can be used during simulation for the same effect.
   +remove_gate_0delays  Change all gates with #0 or #(0, 0, 0) delay to no
         delay (1 bit continuous assigns implemented as gates).  Option can
         significantly speed up simulation but in very rare situation cause
         simulation to fail (#0 delays used to mask races).  If you see a
         large simulation speed up from option, you can probably speed up
         simulation even more by recoding most common cells as udps.  Option
         needed because some simulators only allow delay annotation if gate
         has a delay coded in source.
   +nokeepcommands  Do not save interactive commands to history list.  By
         default,  Interactive commands are saved to history list.  The
         $keepcommands; and $nokeepcommands; system tasks enable and disable
         saving of of history during simulation.  Option should be used when
         interactive input comes from $input or from shell pipe to stdin.
   +define+[symbol] or +define+[symbol]=[string]   Define back quote macro
         symbol [symbol] with an empty text string (first form) for use with
         `ifdef and `ifndef macro facility.  [symbol] does not include back
         quote.  Second form defines symbol with value [string].  [String]
         must not contain white space but can contain anything else including
         surrounding quotes.  Escaped surrounding quotes are converted to
         normal quotes while non escaped will probably be removed
         by your shell.  The $scan$plusargs system task is an alternative
         for setting preprocessor values into variables.
   +incdir+[path]+[path]+...+  Define paths that are searched for `include
         files when `include file not found in current directory.  Only
         `include files that are non absolute paths (not staring with '/'
         or '.' or '..' or '~') are searched for using +incdir paths.
         Paths that do not end with '/' have a '/' path separator appended
         to end.  For file included in different directory, files included
         from it are still searched for in original (not include file)
         directory.  Multiple +incdir+ options may be specified.  Paths
         directories are searched in order of +incdir+ options.
   +sdf_log_file [file]  File is used for SDF annotation instead of default
         writing of SDF messages and errors to Verilog log file.
   +sdf_annotate [file] or +sdf_annotate [file]+[scope reference]  File must
         be in IEEE P1497 standard delay file format.  File is read and used
         to set delay and specify values.  +mindelays, +typdelays or
         +maxdelays setting used to select rtriple value.  Multiple
         +sdf_annotate options (and files) allowed.  If +[scope reference]
         provided, SDF path references relative to scope.  Otherwise, SDF
         paths rooted (context is entire design).  Annotation files processed
         in option order.  Alternatively, $sdf_annotate system task can be
         used to annotate delays.  See systsks.1 man page for documentation.
         Large designs that require large SDF files load somewhat faster if
         command line option instead of system task is used.
   +sdfverbose  Emit trace messages giving new delay value for every delay
         changed during +sdf_annotate delay annotation.  Option can generate
         voluminous output.
   +sdf_noerrors  Do not emit SDF annotation error messages.  SDF errors do
         not stop simulation but cause SDF object delay setting to be skipped
         so +maxerrors error limit does not apply.  Use this option to turn
         off printing of SDF error messages.
   +sdf_nowarns  Do not emit warning messages during SDF annotation.  SDF
         warnings and informs can also be suppressed by message number
         using +suppress_warns+ option.
   +switchverbose  Emit trace and size messages for inout and tran gate
         switch channels elaboration. Use this option to print progress
         messages when simulating models with very large switch channels.
   +change_port_type  Some designs require ports that are not declared as
         inout but are connected as inouts and require bidirectional signal
         flow for correct simulation have their port type changes to inout.
         Use this option to cause port direction to be changed to inout for
         input ports with loconn drivers and for output ports with highconn
         drivers.  WARNING: Use of this option may be required to match
         results of other simulators that use port collapsing algorithm.
   +no_separate_nb_queue  Cver non blocking event scheduling algorithm has
         changed to match XL (all non blocking events scheduled only
         after all #0 events processed).  Use this option for backward
         compatibility with old cver algorithm that mixed non blocking
         eventing in the #0 queue.  If using this option changes your
         results, your circuit probably has a race.
   +nospecify  Simulation run with specify section ignored.  This option
         causes specify section to be read and parsed but it is discarded
         before simulation.  +nospecify of course implies +notimingchecks.
   +nointeractive  Option turns off interactive environment, interrupt signal
         (^c) causes immediate termination.  $stop causes a warning to be
         printed without stopping.  Suppress warning 560 to silently ignore
         stops.  If machine code simulation option +compiled_sim is selected,
          this option is automatically turned on.
   +snapshot  If +nointeractive option is selected, if interrupt signal
         (^c) is generated, this option causes a port mortem activity
         snapshot to be printed before program termination.  Debugger
         :where and $snapshot system task produces same output without
         ending simulation.
